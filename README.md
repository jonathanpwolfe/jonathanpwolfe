- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonathanpwolfe and I'm a software engineer. I have a Bachelors in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Astrophysics. I have worked on research for Binary Black Hole Systems under UNM Professor Lau. I worked at Revature both as an associate and as an Automation Test Lead for a leading Financial Instition.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Java, Python, Data Science, Research, Mathematics, Physics, Astrophysics, Cyber Security, Angular, Game Design, C#, C++. My ultimate goal would be to work on AI that is somehow related to Astronmy. though currently i am just looking for experience coding. Outside of coding I like to play guitar (mostly metalcore/post-hardcore/easycore) and game. I'm also quite fond of darts.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning on Udemy, as well as Cyber Secuity, C#, C++ and more in-depth knowledge of linux.   i plan on getting my masters degree in machiine learning as i think the blend on mathematics and CS is right up my alley.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything in my areas of interest. Research would be nice.  contact me if you're interested.
