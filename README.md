- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jonathanpwolfe, closed source. All of my repos that are worthy are private. I am probably tapping a foot or two right now. Perhaps even behind a drum kit. 
-  Iâ€™m interested in developing apps of a musical nature the most. I am currently developing a guitar based music theory application.
- 
-  While Java and rust are my best languages, I frequently code in Python, (Java/Type)Script or C/C++.
- 
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a musical, or security project.  contact me if you're interested.

- i am also @howamiroot
