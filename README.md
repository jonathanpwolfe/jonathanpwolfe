- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonathanpwolfe and I'm a software engineer. I have a Bachelors in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Astrophysics. I done research for Binary Black Hole Systems. I worked at Revature both as an associate and as an Automation Test Lead for a leading Financial Instition. I have been coding in various languages off and on since i was kid in 2001 starting with QBasic. I did study CS at university, taking programming at the 100, 200 and 300 levels, as well as taking a class on the mathematical principles of CS. I decided to pursue Software Engineering as a profession in 2019.  I prefer challenging problems to easy ones.  I believe my mathematical background provides a different take on CS that should prove usefull on projects.  I plan on pursuing a Masters degree in CS starting in 2022.

- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Java, Python, Data Science, Research, Mathematics, Physics, Astrophysics, Cyber Security, App Development, Angular, Game Design, C#, C++, C and Linux. My ultimate goal would be to work on AI that is somehow related to Physics. Though currently i am just looking for professional experience coding. Outside of coding I like to play guitar (mostly metalcore/post-hardcore/easycore) and play video games such as CounterStrike. I'm also quite fond of shooting darts.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning on Udemy, as well as Cyber Secuity, C#, C++ and more in-depth knowledge of linux.  
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything in my areas of interest. Research would be nice.  contact me if you're interested.
